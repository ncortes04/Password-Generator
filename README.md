This was a long and lengthy process that was very frustrating. I had made mutiple different version sof this code in the process and finally constructed a working one; however it did not meet the criteria. I had created multiiple functions that randomly selected chnaracters in a for loop and was randomly assorted in a seperate function. I did that by creating a veriable including many numbers,letters, and sybols. This made my code very long and tedious but the code worked. I had been searching the web and reading articles on hoe to reduce my code. I had discovered multiple algorithms that i tried to incorporate in my code to make it more simplistic. The more i tried the more bugs i ran into which resulted in more code needing to be written. I have finally completed writing this code and am proud to say that i finally have an understanding on how my code communicates with eachother.
